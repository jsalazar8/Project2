      <p>EA Sports FC 24 is the first of its kind. Not only is the first football game made by EA that is not partenerd with FIFA, but it introduced crossplay for all game modes. Which was highly requested in past FIFAs.</p>

      <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
      <p>I personally purchased EA Sports FC 24 Ultimate Edition, and got early access.</p> 
      <p>The introduction of crossplay across all game modes has made the game more enjoyable for me because I get to play Clubs and Ultimate Team with friends that are on different platforms.</p> 
      <p>Overall I think this is a very solid game and hope it doesn't dissapoint. </p>
